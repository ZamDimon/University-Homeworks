# Air Pollution Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that analyzes air pollution data from the [Ukrainian Ministry of Environment](https://mepr.gov.ua/diyalnist/napryamky/ekologichnyj-monitoryng/stan-atmosfernogo-povitrya/) data. 

## How to Run?

1. Open the [Ukrainian Ministry of Environment](https://mepr.gov.ua/diyalnist/napryamky/ekologichnyj-monitoryng/stan-atmosfernogo-povitrya/) website.
2. Open the city you are interested in. In my particular case, I analyze 
the city of Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr.
3. Download the dataset and save it in the `.csv` format.
4. Save the downloaded file in the `csv` folder of this repository.
5. Finally, run the `main.py` script with the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Unfortunately, the official website does not directly provide the `.csv` files, so > you will need to download all the Excel files manually and make `.csv` file
> by yourself. That is how it is.
