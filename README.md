This repository contains my homework from _V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University_, **Applied Mathematics** major. All homework is written in *Ukrainian* (except for foreign language classes and programming classes). Each of the folders contain a brief `README.md` file explaining what was learned during the corresponding term.
